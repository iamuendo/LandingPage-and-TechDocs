          <h1>Introduction to Cyber Security for Absolute Beginners</h1>
          <article>
            <p>
              If we talk in simpler terms, Cyber security is that part which
              helps business and organization form electronic threats.
              Electronic threats can be defensive devices, hackers, and
              machines. The Cyber security of today, works on defending
              computers, networks, databases, and smartphones from the threat.
              No one notices the hard work of these cyber security
              professionals. They protect you from unauthorized exploitation of
              your systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              In our Cyber security tutorial, every kind of cyber security
              certificate is awarded along with why it is critical and which one
              is for you, everything is included. The training includes Ethical
              hacking, penetration testing, injection, SQL, and risk and
              security management training. Along with these, youâ€™ll be prepared

              The security of any organization starts with three principles: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. And next in this cyber security for beginners tutorial we will learn about the CIA Triad, which has served as the industry standard for computer security since the time of first mainframes.

            <ul>
              <li>Confidentiality: The principles of confidentiality assert that only authorized parties can access sensitive information and functions. Example: military secrets.</li>
              <li>Integrity: The principles of integrity assert that only authorized people and means can alter, add, or remove sensitive information and functions. Example: a user entering incorrect data into the database.</li>
              <li>Availability: The principles of availability assert that systems, functions, and data must be available on-demand according to agreed-upon parameters based on levels of service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We have already created our very first Vue app! This looks pretty
              similar to rendering a string template, but Vue has done a lot of
              work under the hood. The data and the DOM are now linked, and
              everything is now reactive. How do we know? Take a look at the
              example below where counter property increments every second and
              you will see how rendered DOM changes:
            </p>
            <p>JS:</p>
            <p>
              <code
                >const CounterApp = { data() { return { counter: 0 } },
                mounted() { setInterval(() => { this.counter++ }, 1000) }
                }</code
              >
            </p>

          <h1>Handling User Input</h1>
          <article>
            <p>
              To let users interact with your app, we can use the v-on directive
              to attach event listeners that invoke methods on our instances:
            </p>
            <p>HTML:</p>
            <p>
              <code
                >&lt;div id="event-handling"> &lt;p&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;button v-on:click=<wbr />"reverseMessage"><wbr />Reverse
                Message&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code
              >
            </p>
            <p>JS:</p>
            <p>
              <code
                >const EventHandling = { data() { return { message: 'Hello
                Vue.js!' } }, methods: { reverseMessage() { this.message =
                this.message .split('') .reverse() .join('') } } }
                Vue.createApp<wbr />(EventHandling)<wbr />.mount('#event-handling')</code
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that in this method we update the state of our app without
              touching the DOM - all DOM manipulations are handled by Vue, and
              the code you write is focused on the underlying logic.

          <article>
            <p>It's easy to toggle the presence of an element, too:</p>
            <p>HTML</p>
            <p>
              <code
                >&lt;div id="conditional-rendering"&gt; &lt;span v-if="seen">Now
                you see me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code
              >
            </p>
            <p>JS:</p>
            <p>
              <code
                >const ConditionalRendering = { data() { return { seen: true } }
                } Vue.createApp<wbr />(ConditionalRendering)<wbr />.mount('#conditional-rendering')</code
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              This example demonstrates that we can bind data to not only text
              and attributes, but also the structure of the DOM. Moreover, Vue
              also provides a powerful transition effect system that can
              automatically apply transition effects when elements are
              inserted/updated/removed by Vue.

          <header>Relation to Custom Elements</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              You may have noticed that Vue components are very similar to
              Custom Elements, which are part of the Web Components Spec. That's
              because Vue's component syntax is loosely modeled after the spec.
              For example, Vue components implement the Slot API and the is
              special attribute. However, there are a few key differences:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The Web Components Spec has been finalized but is not natively
                implemented in every browser.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Safari 10.1+, Chrome 54+ and Firefox 63+ natively support
                    web components.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In comparison, Vue components work consistently in all
                    supported browsers (IE11 with compatibility build and
                    above).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When needed, Vue components can also be wrapped inside a
                    native custom element.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Vue components provide important features that are not available
                in plain custom elements, most notably cross-component data
                flow, custom event communication and build tool integrations.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Although Vue doesn't use custom elements internally, it has great
              interoperability when it comes to consuming or distributing as
              custom elements. Vue CLI also supports building Vue components
              that register themselves as native custom elements.
