          <h1>Introduction to Cyber Security for Absolute Beginners</h1>
          <article>
            <p>
              If we talk in simpler terms, Cyber security is that part which
              helps business and organization form electronic threats.
              Electronic threats can be defensive devices, hackers, and
              machines. The Cyber security of today, works on defending
              computers, networks, databases, and smartphones from the threat.
              No one notices the hard work of these cyber security
              professionals. They protect you from unauthorized exploitation of
              your systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              In our Cyber security tutorial, every kind of cyber security
              certificate is awarded along with why it is critical and which one
              is for you, everything is included. The training includes Ethical
              hacking, penetration testing, injection, SQL, and risk and
              security management training. Along with these, you’ll be prepared
              even for cybersecurity- interviews.

              Next up, this cyber security for beginners tutorial will help you understand some of the terminologies you must be familiar with before learning anything about cybersecurity. 
            </p>  
            <ol>
              <li>Network
                <p>A network is a connection between two or more computers so that they can communicate with each other.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Internet
                <p>Internet is a means of connecting a computer to any other computer anywhere in the world via dedicated routers and servers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Internet Protocol
                <p>The data that is transferred or received cannot follow any path. There are a set of rules that are followed to control the flow of the internet. These rules are called internet protocol.</p>
              </li>
              <li>IP Address
                <p>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is an address assigned to all devices that connect to a computer network and uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address looks like this: 168.192.10.3</p>
              </li>
              <li>Domain Name Server(DNS)
                <p>Consider DNS as the phonebook of the internet. All the IP addresses and the name of the links are saved in it. For example, you want to go to google.com. You type this on your web application. Then, this name goes to the DNS server, and the DNS server finds the IP address of google.com. Then, the DNS server returns it to your computer with the IP address.</p>

              The security of any organization starts with three principles: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. And next in this cyber security for beginners tutorial we will learn about the CIA Triad, which has served as the industry standard for computer security since the time of first mainframes.

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: The principles of confidentiality assert that only authorized parties can access sensitive information and functions. Example: military secrets.</li>
              <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: The principles of integrity assert that only authorized people and means can alter, add, or remove sensitive information and functions. Example: a user entering incorrect data into the database.</li>
              <li><strong>Availability</strong>: The principles of availability assert that systems, functions, and data must be available on-demand according to agreed-upon parameters based on levels of service.</li>
            </ul>

              Next up in the cyber security for beginners tutorial, let’s look at the areas and speciality in cybersecurity to understand the space better.

            <p>
              The term ‘Hacker’ was coined to describe experts who used their skills to re-develop mainframe systems, increasing their efficiency and allowing them to multi-task. Nowadays, the term routinely describes skilled programmers who gain unauthorized access into computer systems by exploiting weaknesses or using bugs, motivated either by malice or mischief. For example, a hacker can create algorithms to crack passwords, penetrate networks, or even disrupt network services.
