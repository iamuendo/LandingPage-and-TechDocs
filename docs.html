          <article>
            <p>
              If we talk in simpler terms, Cyber security is that part which
              helps business and organization form electronic threats.
              Electronic threats can be defensive devices, hackers, and
              machines. The Cyber security of today, works on defending
              computers, networks, databases, and smartphones from the threat.
              No one notices the hard work of these cyber security
              professionals. They protect you from unauthorized exploitation of
              your systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              In our Cyber security tutorial, every kind of cyber security
              certificate is awarded along with why it is critical and which one
              is for you, everything is included. The training includes Ethical
              hacking, penetration testing, injection, SQL, and risk and
              security management training. Along with these, you’ll be prepared

              Next up, this cyber security for beginners tutorial will help you understand some of the terminologies you must be familiar with before learning anything about cybersecurity. 
            </p>  
            <ol>
              <li>Network
                <p>A network is a connection between two or more computers so that they can communicate with each other.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Internet
                <p>Internet is a means of connecting a computer to any other computer anywhere in the world via dedicated routers and servers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Internet Protocol
                <p>The data that is transferred or received cannot follow any path. There are a set of rules that are followed to control the flow of the internet. These rules are called internet protocol.</p>
              </li>
              <li>IP Address
                <p>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is an address assigned to all devices that connect to a computer network and uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address looks like this: 168.192.10.3</p>
              </li>
              <li>Domain Name Server(DNS)
                <p>Consider DNS as the phonebook of the internet. All the IP addresses and the name of the links are saved in it. For example, you want to go to google.com. You type this on your web application. Then, this name goes to the DNS server, and the DNS server finds the IP address of google.com. Then, the DNS server returns it to your computer with the IP address.</p>

              The security of any organization starts with three principles: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. And next in this cyber security for beginners tutorial we will learn about the CIA Triad, which has served as the industry standard for computer security since the time of first mainframes.

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: The principles of confidentiality assert that only authorized parties can access sensitive information and functions. Example: military secrets.</li>
              <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: The principles of integrity assert that only authorized people and means can alter, add, or remove sensitive information and functions. Example: a user entering incorrect data into the database.</li>
              <li><strong>Availability</strong>: The principles of availability assert that systems, functions, and data must be available on-demand according to agreed-upon parameters based on levels of service.</li>

              The term ‘Hacker’ was coined to describe experts who used their skills to re-develop mainframe systems, increasing their efficiency and allowing them to multi-task. Nowadays, the term routinely describes skilled programmers who gain unauthorized access into computer systems by exploiting weaknesses or using bugs, motivated either by malice or mischief. For example, a hacker can create algorithms to crack passwords, penetrate networks, or even disrupt network services.

            <p>It's easy to toggle the presence of an element, too:</p>
            <p>HTML</p>
            <p>
              <code
                >&lt;div id="conditional-rendering"&gt; &lt;span v-if="seen">Now
                you see me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code
              >
            </p>
            <p>JS:</p>
            <p>
              <code
                >const ConditionalRendering = { data() { return { seen: true } }
                } Vue.createApp<wbr />(ConditionalRendering)<wbr />.mount('#conditional-rendering')</code

              This example demonstrates that we can bind data to not only text
              and attributes, but also the structure of the DOM. Moreover, Vue
              also provides a powerful transition effect system that can
              automatically apply transition effects when elements are
              inserted/updated/removed by Vue.

          <header>Relation to Custom Elements</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              You may have noticed that Vue components are very similar to
              Custom Elements, which are part of the Web Components Spec. That's
              because Vue's component syntax is loosely modeled after the spec.
              For example, Vue components implement the Slot API and the is
              special attribute. However, there are a few key differences:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The Web Components Spec has been finalized but is not natively
                implemented in every browser.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Safari 10.1+, Chrome 54+ and Firefox 63+ natively support
                    web components.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In comparison, Vue components work consistently in all
                    supported browsers (IE11 with compatibility build and
                    above).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When needed, Vue components can also be wrapped inside a
                    native custom element.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Vue components provide important features that are not available
                in plain custom elements, most notably cross-component data
                flow, custom event communication and build tool integrations.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Although Vue doesn't use custom elements internally, it has great
              interoperability when it comes to consuming or distributing as
              custom elements. Vue CLI also supports building Vue components
              that register themselves as native custom elements.
